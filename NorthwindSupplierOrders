-- Using the NorthWind dataebase available at from micorsoft. I join 2 tables and group by a convenient id --

--The table created lists the suppliers and how many products are on order from each, and totals the cost of the orders
for each --

select Suppliers.SupplierID, Suppliers.CompanyName, sum(Products.UnitsOnOrder) as TotalOrdered,  
sum(Products.UnitsOnOrder*Products.UnitPrice) as TotalCost
from Products, Suppliers
where Products.SupplierID=Suppliers.SupplierID
group by Suppliers.SupplierID, Suppliers.CompanyName
