-- Similar to NorthWindSupplierOrders, I join 2 tables and group by a convenient id --

--The table created lists the how many products are on order, and totals the cost of the orders
for each category of item --

select Categories.Categoryid, Categories.CategoryName,
sum(Products.UnitsOnOrder) as TotalOrdered, sum(Products.UnitsOnOrder*Products.UnitPrice) as TotalCost
from categories, Products
where Categories.CategoryID=Products.CategoryID
group by Categories.CategoryID, Categories.CategoryName, Products.CategoryID
